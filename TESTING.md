# Testing
Deployed App at [links-sw.herokuapp.com](https://links-sw.herokuapp.com)
Back to main [README.md](README.md)

A mix of manual and automated testing has been used to ensure the app works as intended. Currently, there are no outstanding bugs or issues that I am aware of, but never say never.
If any bugs / issues / generally undesirable behaviour is found, I'd be grateful if you could take the time to report it to me through the built in support system [here](https://links-sw.herokuapp.com/accounts/support/).

## Automated Testing

### Unit Tests
A suite of 80 tests (at last count) are in place to test the app. Approximately half of these were written alongside the project itself, and mainly relate to the individual apps for `accounts`, `support`, `premium`, `intro pages` and so on - basically everything but the main links app itself.
The remaining tests for the `links` and `search` apps were written after the app was complete and will be useful for when the app is expanded at a later date.

To run the tests locally (on Windows) use `python manage.py test`

### Coverage
The [Coverage](https://pypi.org/project/coverage/) library was used throughout testing to help keep track of how much of my code was covered by the tests. As it stands, there is 77% coverage across the project. I would have liked to have added more tests, especially ones focused on the main links app and associated helper functions in the utils folder, but time became a factor. However, even without the additional tests, I feel that along with the manual testing I've completed, the app is in good health and works as expected.

To generate your own coverage report (again, on Windows)
- Coverage should already be installed from the `requirements.txt` file, but if not, install with `pip install coverage`
- Run `coverage run manage.py test`
- Then `coverage html` to generate the report
- The report can be viewed in a browser by opening the `index.html` file from inside the `htmlcolv` folder.



## Manual Testing

### Device Compatibility
The app has been tested across a range of different devices, browsers, and screen sizes. The tables below show what has been tested, along with the results of these tests.

### Features Testing
All features have been tested to to ensure they work as intended. Each test is listed below, and it shows the test undertook, what steps were taken to complete the test, any issues encountered, and the end result.
Tests were initially completed on a PC running Windows 10, and then repeated on other devices. **[list other devices]**

## Code Validation

### Python
All Python code is fully PEP 8 compliant, and has been verified at [pep8online.com](http://pep8online.com/).

### Javascript
All Javascript has been verified with the online tool [jshint.com](https://jshint.com/).

### HTML
HTML has been run through [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/). Outside of errors generated by the Django templating language, all other HTML is valid.

### CSS
The CSS is auto-prefixed and compiled from multiple .scss files using the VS Code [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) extension.
